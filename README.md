# cricket-scorer-backend

For this back-end, I decided to learn my Python and MongoDB, so I have setup Flask and it communicates with a MongoDB database hosted on my local.

## Instructions

Run Mongodb
```
mongosh
```

Specify the Flask App route from the terminal if need be
```
export FLASK_APP=app
```

Run Flask server
```
flask run
```

Run Flask server with debug on to enable hot reloading
```
flask --debug run
```

Seed players with your Python executable by running the seeders as a module. I have Python3, thus I use this
```
python3 -m seeders.seed_players
```

After a long break, working on the system again, trying to get data saving with an actualy form and not a set JSON request.

Setup of Flask and integration with MongoDB on my local machine. Code was generated by the help of ChatGPT and any valid JSON current POST /insert requests work and saves successfully into the db.
